# Tuple generation

The aim is several collections as follows. The `2ples` collection contains items like this:

```javascript
{
  _id: 'diabetes||test',
  n: 3
}
```

This would mean the two words `diabetes` and `test` occur together in 3 codes in the dictionary.

Similarly there would be `nples` collections where the `n` represents the number of words.
